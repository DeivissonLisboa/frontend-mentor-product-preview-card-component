## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I attempted to estimate the time it would take to complete and ended up taking one and a half hours, which was 30 minutes more than I estimated.

```css
@media (min-width: 35rem) {
  main {
    max-width: 35rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

Working with the mobile-first workflow is enjoyable, as it is significantly easier compared to its counterpart.

### Continued development

semantic HTML, CUBE CSS still new to me and i'll be jure to learn more.
